# Hi there, I‚Äôm Varshil Gandhi üëã

**Machine Learning Engineer @ Glide Technology**  
Led an AI/ML team on an end-to-end Edge AI project‚Äîfrom data collection through model deployment on edge devices‚Äîwhile also exploring AWS Cloud deployments. Currently pursuing a Data Science & Machine Learning master‚Äôs at Scaler Academy.

üî≠ I‚Äôm focused on:
- Building full ML pipelines (computer vision, classical ML, neural networks)  
- Optimizing & quantizing models for edge inference (i.MX93/95)  
- Deploying and monitoring models on Edge Device
