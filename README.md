# Hi there, I’m Varshil Gandhi 👋

**Machine Learning Engineer @ Glide Technology**  
Led an AI/ML team on an end-to-end Edge AI project—from data collection through model deployment on edge devices—while also exploring AWS Cloud deployments. Currently pursuing a Data Science & Machine Learning master’s at Scaler Academy.

🔭 I’m focused on:
- Building full ML pipelines (computer vision, classical ML, neural networks)  
- Optimizing & quantizing models for edge inference (i.MX93/95)  
- Deploying and monitoring models on Edge Device
